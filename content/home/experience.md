  As an intern with the Perception team, I mainly focused on designing and developing an Extended Object Tracking algorithm that can detect, track and estimate the extents of objects in real-time using Radar measurements alone. Towards the end of the internship I also worked on improving the performance of neural networks in detecting distant objects by the early fusion of multiple sensor modalities.

  I was part of a racing team called AMZ Driverless wherein we built a fully autonomous race car, "gotthard driverless", that ended up winning all the events it took part in. As part of the team I was in charge of the LiDAR module of the car and was responsible for everything related to LiDAR right from the sensor selection, to algorithm development, to successful integration with other modules of the car. During this time I also developed a novel Deep Learning based approach to estimate the colours of track-delimiting cones using the intensity patterns of LiDAR returns.

I worked with Dr. rer. nat. Oliver Hohlfeld on a research project that aimed at decreasing the latency, thereby increasing throughput, of network cards by caching the network replies of applications in the linux kernel. As part of the project I integrated MySQL with the customized linux kernel, and designed and executed comprehensive evaluation tests to compare the actual speedup to that of the expected one. After analyzing the results, I also proposed changes to the architecture that could further help in Latency Minimization and Packet Acceleration.
