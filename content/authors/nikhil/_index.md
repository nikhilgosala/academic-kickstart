I am Master's student in Computer Science at ETH Zürich and I am interested in exploring research areas at the intersection of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Specifically, I am interested in research problems that focus on perception, planning, and prediction for autonomous mobile robots.

I am currently working as a research intern at nuTonomy/Aptiv, Singapore wherein I am focusing on improving the performance of detection and tracking of objects in real-time both by using radar only, and by fusing multiple sensor modalities.

I was also part of the Akademischer Motorsportverein Zürich (AMZ) Driverless team for two seasons, wherein I worked on the LiDAR module of the car in the first season before leading the Perception and Software Architecture teams in the second season. [Here](https://youtu.be/HegmIXASKow?t=11691) is a video showing our car «gotthard driverless» zooming around autonomously at the competition in Germany.

My hobbies include playing sports, especially tennis, travelling, and photography. Some of my best photos can be found [here] and my travel journal can be found [here]!
